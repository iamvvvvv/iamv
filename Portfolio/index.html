      <h3>Cybersecurity Specialist</h3>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Eyvazli Vidadi, a passionate individual with 1.5 years of hands-on experience in the
        Cybersecurity field. My journey in cybersecurity has been driven by a keen interest in both offensive (Red Team)
        and defensive (Blue Team) strategies.</p>

      <p>In my professional endeavors, I've had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies such as Splunk,
        ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and Wazuh SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). My
        familiarity with these platforms has allowed me to effectively monitor, detect, and respond to security threats,
        ensuring the integrity of the systems I protect.</p>

      <p>Moreover, my experience extends to the realm of Extended Detection and Response (XDR), particularly with Cortex
        XDR. Leveraging this powerful tool, I've been able to correlate and analyze security data across various
        endpoints, networks, and cloud environments, bolstering our organization's defense against sophisticated
        threats.</p>

      <p>On the offensive side, I've honed my skills in penetration testing through platforms like Hack The Box,
        TryHackMe, and PortSwigger. By immersing myself in simulated environments and real-world challenges, I've gained
        invaluable insights into identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening the security posture of organizations.
      </p>

      <p>Driven by relentless curiosity and a dedication to continuous learning, I am committed to staying at the
        forefront of cybersecurity trends and techniques. With a blend of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and a
        passion for cybersecurity, I'm ready to tackle the challenges of today's digital landscape head-on. Let's secure
        the future together!</p>
